# hello-world

Projects which are on my list for the next couple of years:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a marriage App: 
    - This App will be a tool to help you to grow in good conversations with your partner
    - It offers you a number of questions with different topics e.g. "Do you want to have children" 
    
2. Create a cross-platform App for Habits
    - This Web- and native App will be a App which helps you to grow in a value-driven character. 
    - Which habit do you want to learn? We'll try to offer courses to help you grow in humanity, generosity, thankfulness

3. Wordpress Theme
    - I want to start developing wordpress themes. 
    - The themes will be simple but professional. That's the aim.
